# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Project

This repository contains the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to solve a machine learning problem, such as image classification, 
object detection, or other computer vision tasks. The project is built using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.

---

## Introduction

A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** is a type of deep learning algorithm used primarily in image and video recognition. This project implements a CNN model for tasks such as:
- Image classification
- Object detection
- Feature extraction

The model architecture includes convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

## Features
- Image preprocessing and augmentation.
- A modular CNN architecture.
- Training, validation, and testing scripts.
- Visualization of training metrics (e.g., accuracy and loss).
- Model performance evaluation with confusion matrix and metrics.
